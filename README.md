# ArcticFreight — 中欧北极快航运力与温敏货物协同保障后端

ArcticFreight is a self-contained Go backend that coordinates reefer slot
booking, carrier confirmation, port handover and temperature monitoring for the
China-Europe Arctic fast-route peak-season service.

## Participants modelled

- **承运方** Haijie Shipping (海杰航运)
- **货主** power-battery and energy-storage-cabinet shippers in Ningbo / Yiwu
- **港口节点** Ningbo-Zhoushan (origin) and Hamburg (destination)
- **温控服务商** third-party temperature service

## Workflows

1. **货主在线锁舱** — shipper locks reefer capacity (payment-time ordered, no overbooking).
2. **承运方确认舱位并分配冷藏电源** — carrier confirms and assigns a power circuit.
3. **港口装卸与转运衔接** — load → transit → discharge → temperature handover → sign.
4. **温控服务商分段上报温度** — per-segment readings every 10 minutes.

## Business rules

- Storage cabinets and power batteries must stay within **0–25 °C**; a breach
  lasting **≥ 15 minutes** alerts all three parties.
- Cancellation must be requested **≥ 72 h** before sailing; later cancellations
  forfeit the deposit.
- Hamburg temperature handover must complete within **2 h** of discharge;
  overdue handovers escalate to manual intervention.
- Temperature records are kept every **10 minutes** and retained for **90 days**
  after sign-off.
- Cargo-damage liability is determined per segment from the temperature record.
- Concurrent lock requests are serialised by **payment time**; overbooking is
  forbidden.
- On recorder power loss the system switches to the **backup recorder** and
  reconstructs missing readings using the average of adjacent records.

## Quick start

```bash
